* Element semantics

  unit-number

    A |unit-number| element represents a number with unit.  It is a
    phrasing content, flow content, and palpable content.  Its content
    model is either a |number-value| element followed by an optional
    |number-unit| element, or one or more sequences of a
    |number-value| element followed by a |number-unit| element finally
    followed by a |number-sign| element.

  number-sign

    A |number-sign| element represents the sign part of the parent
    |unit-number| element.  If the parent is not a |unit-number|
    element, the element represents its content.  Its content model is
    phrasing content.  It may contain any character sequence directly
    or indirectly, which as a whole represents a sign suitable for
    human consumption.

  number-value

    A |number-value| element represents the number part of the parent
    |unit-number| element.  If the parent is not a |unit-number|
    element, the element represents its content.  Its content model is
    phrasing content.  It may contain any character sequence directly
    or indirectly, which as a whole represents a number suitable for
    human consumption.

  number-unit

    A |number-unit| element represents the unit part of the parent
    |unit-number| element.  If the parent is not a |unit-number|
    element, the element represents its content.  Its content model is
    phrasing content.  It may contain any character sequence directly
    or indirectly, which as a whole represents a unit suitable for
    human consumption.

* Dynamic content expansion

The |unit-number.js| script in the |src| directory of this Git
repository implements the |unit-number| element.  It can be loaded by
the usual way:

  <script src=path/to/unit-number.js async></script>

This |script| element can be inserted, whenever desired, into anywhere
in the document in question.  It mutates the content of any
|unit-number| element in the document (including any |unit-number|
element inserted thereafter) with |type| attribute, representing
human-readable equivalent to |value| attribute value.  The content is
also to be updated whenever the |value| attribute value is updated.
Any existing content of the element is discarded.

The |unit-number| element's |value| attribute value must be a
JavaScript floating point number string.  The value of a |unit-number|
element is the result of the JavaScript |parseFloat| function's return
value when applied to the |value| attribute value.

The |unit-number| element's |type| attribute value can be one of
following:

  count

    The element represents a count, i.e. the number of something.  The
    value of the element is the count.

  distance

    The element represents a distance.  The value of the element is
    the distance in meters.

  duration

    The element represents a duration.  The value of the element is
    the duration in seconds.

  lat

    The element represents a latitude.  The value of the element is
    the latitude in degrees.

  lon

    The element represents a longitude.  The value of the element is
    the longitude in degrees.

  percentage

    The element represents a ratio as percentage (%).  The value of
    the element is the ratio, where |0| represents 0% and |1|
    represents 100%.

  rank

    The element represents a rank (as in ranking).  The value of the
    element is the rank number.

Types |count| and |rank| support the |unit| attribute.  If there is a
|unit| attribute, its value is used as the unit.  If the unit begins
with an ASCII letter, a SPACE character is inserted between the number
and the value and a |hasseparator| boolean attribute is specified to
the |unit-number| element.

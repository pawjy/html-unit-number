* Element semantics

  unit-number

    A |unit-number| element represents a number with unit.  It is a
    phrasing content, flow content, and palpable content.  Its content
    model is a |number-value| element followed by a |number-unit|
    element.

  number-value

    A |number-value| element represents the number part of the parent
    |unit-number| element.  If the parent is not a |unit-number|
    element, the element represents its content.  Its content model is
    phrasing content.  It may contain any character sequence directly
    or indirectly, which as a whole represents a number suitable for
    human consumption.

  number-unit

    A |number-unit| element represents the unit part of the parent
    |unit-number| element.  If the parent is not a |unit-number|
    element, the element represents its content.  Its content model is
    phrasing content.  It may contain any character sequence directly
    or indirectly, which as a whole represents a unit suitable for
    human consumption.

* Dynamic content expansion

The |unit-number.js| script in the |src| directory of this Git
repository implements the |unit-number| element.  It can be loaded by
the usual way:

  <script src=path/to/unit-number.js async></script>

This |script| element can be inserted, whenever desired, into anywhere
in the document in question.  It mutates the content of any
|unit-number| element in the document (including any |unit-number|
element inserted thereafter) with |type| attribute, representing
human-readable equivalent to |value| attribute value.  The content is
also to be updated whenever the |value| attribute value is updated.
Any existing content of the element is discarded.

The |unit-number| element's |type| attribute value can be one of
following:

  distance

    The element represents a distance.  The |value| attribute value
    must be a JavaScript floating point number string in meters.
